# LogicMonitor Alert Integrations (Custom HTTP Delivery)

[LogicMonitor version 118](https://www.logicmonitor.com/release-notes/v-118-release-notes/) introduced the ability to import/ export Custom HTTP integrations from any LogicMonitor portal.

We've collected some efforts from LogicMonitor customers and employees and published them here for easy access, and to provide some examples of what's possible.

These alert integrations are only a starting point - APIs change and update all the time, you may want to add/ change/ tweak these, so consider them building blocks - and don't hesitate to [reach out to LogicMonitor support](https://www.logicmonitor.com/support/getting-started/advanced-logicmonitor-setup/get-support-resources/)!
